# HealthBuddy
Application Name: HealthBuddy
The "HealthBuddy" application strives to support the aging population in Singapore. 1 in 4 Singaporeans will be over the age of 65 by 2030. This means that there is an increasing demand in healthcare services such as routine medical check ups for chronic diseases like blood glucose and blood pressure. Hence, the app introduces a health tracker that helps our aging population to monitor their BP and BG, so that they are more self-conscious about their health. This will also help to alleviate the workload of our healthcare givers.
